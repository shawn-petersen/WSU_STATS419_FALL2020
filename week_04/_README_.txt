Sorry, the _README_ was on Blackboard, and I am now adding here.

07 Sharpening the Saw
Posted on: Monday, September 14, 2020 5:42:13 AM PDT

Hi,

So in the dropbox for week 04, at this point I mostly put in Auxiliary files.

Sharpening the Saw is a word document that reviews today's lecture, which is posted on YouTube here:  https://youtu.be/pxKxL6RFgjI
There is some auxiliary information.  I will post a short video on Data Provenance.
I will also be placing one or more RNotebooks in the Dropbox for you to use in your sandbox.  Please note, the purpose of a notebook is to document our learning, so we have breadcrumbs to help us perform certain tasks.  The RNotebook should be verbose.
In today's video I made some references to Intrinsicity which is a PDF and a research project I did during my MBA about understanding legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice [Measure Learning . doc]
The two "india" folders were me playing around with highcharter, and I will provide an update, once I have arrived at a final conclusion.  I am curious how "hcmap" looks when you try and render as a PDF.  Highcharts is a great visualization tool, my conclusions about highcharter are currently leaning in a different direction.
This upcoming Friday, I will be traveling for the weekend, so likely will be AFK.  I will try and get all materials for next week uploaded before Friday.  In the "Sharpening the Saw" word document, there are some details (on page 3, I believe) regarding some of the distance functions you should be thinking about and writing.  After these set of functions, most of the rest of the semester will be using pre-existing functions where we may wrap a bunch of function calls into human-readable functions.
It is important that in the next few days we work out the bugs for Github, RStudio, Knit-to-HTML, Knit-to-PDF with latex template.  I may be around in office hours a bit early (can't guarantee that, since I do need to grab some sleep).  I am may have extended office hours tomorrow.  If you shoot me an email or text (may capture my attention more readily, depending on what I have going on:  509.592.7592), I can make myself available to make certain everyone has a working technical environment.
