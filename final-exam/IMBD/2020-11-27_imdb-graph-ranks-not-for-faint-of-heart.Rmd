# (IMDB) Social Network

## IMDB data

Back to the research question, after a bit of a detour.  Can we apply this method to ascertain the "rank" of movies and actors.  Let's give it a try.  First, remember, we need an adjacency matrix, with movies-linking-to-movies or actors-linking-to-actors.  It needs to be row/col symmetric in form (although the elements of the matrix do not need to be symmetric).

We don't have that form yet.  We can build a matrix with actors in the rows and movies in the columns; or vice versa.  So what can we do.

### Build the relationships of actors-movies

Choosing how to define (or truncate the matrix) may influence the results, but not by much.  A dud movie/actor will still be a dud.

So let's take the new movie-actor collection and build a matrix.  For now, we will only place a binary value (0 or 1) to represent a link between an actor and a movie.  We may later weight the values based on being a headliner or a director or whatever.

```{r}
library(imdb);
packageVersion("imdb");  # ‘0.1.1’

imdb::loadDataIMDB();
names(imdb.data);
```

```{r}
network = imdb.data$movies.df$cast;
dim(network);
names(network);

n.ttid = length(unique(network$ttid));
n.nmid = length(unique(network$nmid));

my.ttids = sort( unique(network$ttid) );
my.nmids = sort( unique(network$nmid) );
```
We have a network of 10,193 movies and 64,666 actors (not including creatives).  This is a big matrix, but is likely sparse ... let's see if R can handle it as-is.  If not, there are "sparse-matrix" techniques we could utilize.

I call the matrix "AM" actors for rows, movies for columns.

```{r}
# AM = matrix(0, nrow=n.nmid, ncol=n.ttid);
#   rownames(A) = my.nmids;
#   colnames(A) = my.ttids;
# dim(AM);
# AM[1:10,1:5];
```
This next step will be time-consuming... We have to loop through each record of the network cast dataframe, grab the ttid and nmid, figure out the corresponding row/col and populate with a 1.

We only have 120,678 entries and our matrix is 64666 * 10193 = 659,140,538 elements.  That is 0.0183% sparse.

```{r}
# nrow = nrow(network);
# nrow;
# 
# for(i in 1:nrow)
#   {
#   if(i %% 25000 == 1) { print(i); flush.console();}
#   row = network[i,];
#   ttid = row$ttid;
#   nmid = row$nmid;
#   
#   r = which(my.nmids == nmid);
#   c = which(my.ttids == ttid);
#   AM[r,c] = 1;
#   }
# 
# sum(AM);
```

### AA from AM

I can build an actor-actor matrix by multiplying the AM matrix by its transpose.

```{r}
# AA = AM %*% t(AM);
# dim(AA);
```


### MM from AM

I can build an actor-actor matrix by multiplying the AM matrix by its transpose.

```{r}
# MM = t(AM) %*% (AM);
# dim(MM);
```


I am going to augment to the last row, easier to accomplish.


## IMDB data (v 2)
Based on a night's sleep and the video on advanced feature, I want to prevent "gaming" by creating a level playing field.  Increasing N and introducing randomness is how you game PageRank; the patent network makes such gaming more challening and expensive, but possible (e.g., Canon's inkjet printers).  

If we use the top50 as the key for the network, it is constrained and the links are within the "best" as defined by popular50.

We expected WILL to have 19 movies, it appears he has 16; we expected DENZEL to have 19 movies, it appears he has 18.



```{r}
# library(imdb);
# packageVersion("imdb");  # ‘0.1.1’
# 
# imdb::loadDataIMDB();
# names(imdb.data);
```

```{r}
df = subsetDataFrame(imdb.data$movies$popular50, "year", ">=", 1980);
df = subsetDataFrame(df, "year", "<", 2020);
ttids = df$ttid;
dim(df);
```

```{r}
df.cast = merge(df, imdb.data$movies.df$cast, by="ttid");
dim(df.cast);
length(unique(df.cast$ttid));
length(unique(df.cast$nmid));
```
We have a full dataset, about 2000 movies and 29,601 actor-links.  We have about 17,150 unique actors.

```{r}
network = df.cast;
n.ttid = length(unique(network$ttid));
n.nmid = length(unique(network$nmid));

my.ttids = sort( unique(network$ttid) );
my.nmids = sort( unique(network$nmid) );
```


```{r}
AM = matrix(0, nrow=n.nmid, ncol=n.ttid);
  rownames(AM) = my.nmids;
  colnames(AM) = my.ttids;
dim(AM);
AM[1:10,1:5];
```

We only have 29,601 entries and our matrix is 17149 * 1998 = 34,263,702 elements.  That is 0.0863% sparse.

```{r}
nrow = nrow(network);
nrow;

for(i in 1:nrow)
  {
  if(i %% 25000 == 1) { print(i); flush.console();}
  row = network[i,];
  ttid = row$ttid;
  nmid = row$nmid;

  r = which(my.nmids == nmid);
  c = which(my.ttids == ttid);
  AM[r,c] = 1;
  }

sum(AM);
```

### AA from AM

I can build an actor-actor matrix by multiplying the AM matrix by its transpose.

```{r}
# timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# AA = AM %*% t(AM);
# timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
# print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs"));  # "Time: 392.57 secs"
# dim(AA);
```


### MM from AM

I can build an actor-actor matrix by multiplying the AM matrix by its transpose.

```{r}
# timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# MM = t(AM) %*% (AM);
# timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
# print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs")); # "Time: 45.83 secs"
# dim(MM); 
```

### CPP for SPEED
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35923787/fast-large-matrix-multiplication-in-r?noredirect=1&lq=1>

I have used "Eigen" before to do this matrix math.  We are still struggling with base-R, so let's try and see if we can speed things up.

```{r}
# include.me = paste0(path.github, "humanVerseWSU/R/functions-file.R");
# source_url( include.me );
# this.path = getDirectoryOfThisFile();  # will work in RStudio
# setwd(this.path);
this.path = path.to.nascent;
setwd(this.path);

# Requires Rtools on Windoze
# install.packages("RcppEigen", type="source");
# install.packages("RcppArmadillo", type="source");

library(Rcpp)

A <- matrix(rnorm(10000), 100, 100) # fully populated, 100 x 100, relatively small
B <- matrix(rnorm(10000), 100, 100)

library(microbenchmark)
# I added "Trans" for Matrix Transpose to this example code.
sourceCpp("multiply.cpp")
microbenchmark(eigenMatTrans(A),A%*%B, armaMatMult(A, B), eigenMatMult(A, B), eigenMapMatMult(A, B))

```

### AAM from AM (C++)

I need a transpose as well: <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1Transpose.html>

```{r}
timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# AA = AM %*% t(AM);
AM.t = eigenMatTrans(AM);
AA = eigenMatMult(AM, AM.t);
rownames(AA) = colnames(AA) = my.nmids;
timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs"));  # "Time: 392.57 secs"
dim(AA);
```
C++ took it from 392 seconds (6.5 minutes) to 15 seconds.  ["Time: 14.8 secs"] ... 26.5 times faster ...


```{r}
timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
# MM = t(AM) %*% (AM);
MM = eigenMatMult(AM.t, AM);
rownames(MM) = colnames(MM) = my.ttids;
timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs")); # "Time: 45.83 secs"
dim(MM);
```

C++ took it from 46 seconds to 2 seconds.  ["Time: 14.8 secs"] ... 21 times faster ...


### Will Smith first-contacts, zero-degrees of separation
```{r}
nmid = "nm0000226";
idx = which(rownames(AA)==nmid);

AA.r = AA[idx,];

idx0 = which(AA.r == 0);

AA.rs = sort(AA.r[-c(idx0,idx)], decreasing=TRUE); # remove zeroes and self

length(AA.rs);  # number of unique actors
sum(AA.rs);  # total ties.  one actor may be higher than another

head(AA.rs,10);
```


### Denzel Washington first-contacts, zero-degrees of separation
```{r}
nmid = "nm0000243";
idx = which(rownames(AA)==nmid);

AA.r = AA[idx,];

idx0 = which(AA.r == 0);

AA.rs = sort(AA.r[-c(idx0,idx)], decreasing=TRUE); # remove zeroes and self

length(AA.rs);  # number of unique actors
sum(AA.rs);  # total ties.  one actor may be higher than another

head(AA.rs,10);
```
Remember, this is a limited network of actors linked to these 2000 movies.

### N - degrees of freedom
This is a largish matrix, will take some time.
```{r}
timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
AA.1 = eigenMatMult(AA, AA); # one degree of separation
timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs"));
```

```{r}
timer.start = as.numeric(Sys.time());
AA.2 = eigenMatMult(AA.1, AA); # two degrees of separation
timer.end = as.numeric(Sys.time());
elapsed = round(timer.end - timer.start,2);
print(paste0("Time: ", elapsed, " secs"));
```



```{r}
nmid1 = "nm0000243"; # denzel
nmid2 = "nm0000226"; # will smith

numberMoviesShared = function(nmid1, nmid2, AA)
  {
  
  }


```
























The augmentation and power approach may be easiest.  Or we can sort and solve the power method.  Adding a lot of small elements (Google method) is not seem like a good option.
```{r}
A.s =
