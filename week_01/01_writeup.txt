Instructions:  Introduce yourself to your instructor.  Be certain to include a picture of yourself that best reflects who you think you naturally are.  Cover important topices (major/minor, where are you from, why did you choose WSU, why did you choose this course, goals for this course, if you are a data analytics major [which track], your strengths (best skills) in math/stats/data analytics, when will you graduate, what is your ideal first job, and what skills do you need to develop to land that first job).  Go to Indeed.com and do some searching on some of the relevant JOB WORDS from above.  Your search does not have to include a location [ https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=statistics  24,175 jobs as of 08/14/2020 4:30PM] ; however, if your goal is to work in a very specific location, you may want to include it.  In your writeup, include a two-column table.  The left-hand column should saw "JOB DEMAND" and the right-hand column should say "MY PREFERENCES".  For each column, rank the top-5 keywords for each.  Discuss your expectations of "what the market demands" and "what you would ideally prefer".  Are your ideals appropriately aligned?  This writeup should be organized in a storytelling format that is enjoyable and easy to read.  At an absolute minimum of 300 words.
