This course will break things down weekly with two lectures a week.  For example, this first week, in addition to the appropriate entries in your thought journal, you will need to prepare and submit via blackboard "01_writeup" and "01_reading" no later then Monday, August 31 before 11:59 PM (almost midnight).

Weekly Zoom office hours will be held on Mondays at 1PM and Thursdays at 8PM.  The goal is to offer varying times to accomodate the different needs you may have.  An appointment for other office hours can be arranged.
